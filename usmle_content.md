-  Biostatistics, Epidemiology/Population Health, and Interpretation of the Medical Literature
    -  Epidemiology/population health
        - Measures of disease frequency: incidence/prevalence
        - Measures of health status: rates, crude and adjusted; reproductive rates (eg, maternal mortality, neonatal/infant/under-5 mortality); mortality, morbidity; standardization; life expectancy, health-adjusted life expectancy; population attributable risk (PAR), population attributable risk percent (PAR%); risk factors
        - Survival analysis interpretation (eg, Kaplan-Meier curve)
        - Composite health status indicators, measures of population impact: years of potential life lost; quality-adjusted life years; disability-adjusted life years; standardized mortality ratio
        - Population pyramids and impact of demographic changes
        - Disease surveillance and outbreak investigation: disease reporting; response to public health advisory, health promotion; recognition of clusters
        - Communicable disease transmission: attack rate; herd immunity; reportable diseases 
        - Points of intervention: primary, secondary; community level (eg, cigarette taxes, soda taxes, smoke-free cities, buildings: restaurants, public buildings); school policies; access, healthy food, transportation, clean air, safe environments
    -  Study design, types and selection of studies (includes dependent/independent variables)
        - Descriptive studies (case report one person/case series more than one) 
        - Analytical studies: observational: community surveys; cross-sectional (individuals); ecological (populations); case control; retrospective and prospective cohort
        - Analytical studies: interventional: clinical trial (randomized controlled trial; double-blind; placebo-controlled; noninferiority/equivalence trials); community intervention
        - Systematic reviews and meta-analysis: potential uses; estimation of effect sizes; heterogeneity; publication bias; forest plots, funnel diagrams; risk of bias, bias risk scale
        - Obtaining and describing samples: matching, inclusion/exclusion criteria, selecting appropriate controls for studies, lack of controls, concealed allocation, randomization, stratification
        - Methods to handle noncompliance: loss to follow-up; intention-to-treat analysis
        - Qualitative analysis
    -  Measures of association
        - Relative risk
        - Odds ratio, hazard ratio
        - Other measures of association: number needed to treat/harm; absolute risk (AR), absolute risk percent (AR%); population attributable risk (PAR), population attributable risk percent (PAR%)
        - Distributions of data: measures of central tendency; measures of variability; regression to mean; normal distribution; nominal measurement
        - Correlation and regression, uses and interpretation: correlation coefficients; multiple regression
    -  Principles of testing and screening
        - Properties of a screening test: validity, accuracy, reliability; criteria for a screening test; confirmatory testing; appropriateness; lead-time bias, length bias; screening vs diagnostic tests
        - Sensitivity and specificity; predictive value, positive and negative
        - ROC curves
        - Probability: theory (independence, product, addition rules); decision trees; likelihood ratios (application of Bayes theorem); posttest, pretest
    -  Study interpretation, drawing conclusions from data
        - Causation: hypothesis-generating vs hypothesis-driven testing; causal criteria, temporality, temporal sequence, dose-response relationship; reverse causality
        - Chance
            - null hypothesis, Type I error and alpha level (multiple comparisons, random error/chance)
            - sample size and Type II error, beta, power
            - selection and interpretation of basic tests of statistical significance: chi-square; confidence intervals; p-values; t-test
            - a priori vs. post hoc analysis: subgroup analysis; error rate; affect types
        - Interpretation of graphs/tables and text
        - Bias, confounding, and threats to validity (includes methods to address)
            - selection, sampling bias
            - information bias: recall; ascertainment, ecologic fallacy, lack of blinding; loss to follow up confounding variables, Hawthorne effect (includes methods to address)
            - other threats to validity (eg, placebo effect)
        - Internal vs. external validity: generalizability (external validity); efficacy vs effectiveness
        - Statistical vs. clinical significance; clinical and surrogate outcome/end point 
    -  Clinical decision making, 
        - interpretation and use of evidence-based data and recommendations: application of study results to patient care and practice, including patient preferences and individualization of risk profiles; risk/benefit analysis; synthesis of concepts with real data
    -  Research ethics
        - Informed consent for research
        - Privacy of patient data (HIPAA)
        - Roles of institutional review boards (IRBs)
        - Intervention analysis: intervention analysis; stopping analysis; safety monitoring 
        - Regulatory issues: drug development, phases of approval; appropriateness of placebo; appropriateness of randomized clinical trial; components of studies; ethics; scheduling; off-label use
        - Other issues related to research ethics
